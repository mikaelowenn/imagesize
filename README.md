# Library
First of all, the library we are going to use is opencv
Using your terminal type this command:
```pip install opencv-python```

Inside your python code:
```import opencv```

OpenCV in python is a library which is used for computer vision, image processing and much more.  The imread(filepath) function is used to load an image from the file path specified. The .shape stores a tuple of height, width and no of channels for each pixel. The .shape[:2] will get the height and width of the image.

# How To

Just download the python file, and put it in the same folder with the image you want to measure. Then you're good to go
